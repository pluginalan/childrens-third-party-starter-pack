Pick 'n' Mix Service
====================

This is a Node.JS service which provides the following capabilities;
- Mock of the Package Manager API
- Static web serving (allowing it to be used to serve the contents of any folder on the machine)
- Proxying of requests
- Simulation of chunked downloads (including ability to alter state of running downloads)
- Response overrides
- Request logging

Pre-requisites
--------------
Run 'npm install' to retrieve and install all Node module dependencies

Invocation
----------
Either;
'npm start' to launch with default settings, or

'node picknmix-service' [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                       output usage information
    -p, --port <number>              Set listening port [3030]
    -s, --static <path>              Set static file path [.]
    --packages <path>                Set path to folder of (externally provided) static test packages [./packages]
    -d, --diskspace <bytes>          Set available disk storage [524288000]
    -x, --proxyconfig <path^target>  Set details of a proxy path and target (separated by ^). This option may be repeated as many times as necessary

Proxy configuration
===================
When using the -x option to configure multiple proxies, if one has a path which is a subset of another, the more specific path MUST be specified first.
e.g. /aws/images/png must precede /aws/images, which must precede /aws

Response overrides
==================
Adding entries to the array in responses/overrides.json allows the response to specific URL calls to be explicitly specified, bypassing all normal processing logic.
Entries are in the form: {"path":<request path>,"response":<json response>}
The list of overrides remains unchanged over the lifetime of the service.
